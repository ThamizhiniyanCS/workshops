## What is a Malware?

**Malware** is an executable binary that is malicious in nature. Malware's can be used by attackers to perform variety of malicious actions like Spying on the target using Keyloggers or RAT'S, they can also delete your data or encrypt your data for “Ransom”.

## History of Malware

Malware has evolved since the 1971 creation of the **Creeper Virus** which spread without causing harm. Early malware like Trojans and worms, including the 1981 **Elk Cloner** and the 1988 **Morris Worm**, set the stage for more advanced threats. By 2000, viruses like **ILOVEYOU** wreaked havoc globally, and in 2008, **Conficker** infected millions. Advanced malware like **Stuxnet** (2010) targeted critical infrastructure, while mobile threats like the 2004 **Cabir** worm infected phones. Malware continues to grow more sophisticated, impacting security worldwide.

## What is Malware Analysis?

Malware Analysis is the study or process of determining the functionality, origin and potential impact of a given malware sample and extracting as much information from it. The information that is extracted helps to understand the functionality and scope of malware, how the system was infected and how to defend against similar attacks in future.

## Purpose of Malware Analysis

When analysing malware, it is important to consider the following:

- Point of Entry (PoE) I.e. Was it through spam that our e-mail filtering missed and the user opened the attachment? Let's review our spam filters and train our users better for future prevention!
- Detection and Classification
  - What are the indicators that malware has even been executed on a machine? Are there any files, processes, or perhaps any attempt of "un-ordinary" communication?
- **Behavioural Analysis**
  - How does the malware perform? Does it attempt to infect other devices? Does it encrypt files or install anything like a backdoor / Remote Access Tool (RAT)?
- Most importantly - can we ultimately prevent and/or detect further infection?!
- Threat Intelligence
- Reverse Engineering

## Malware Analysis Techniques

### **Static Analysis**

- Checks code without running it to spot possible threats.
- Provides a high-level overview to determine if code is "malicious."
  - **Signature Matching**: Uses known patterns to detect malware quickly.
  - **File Structure Check**: Looks at the organization of the code.
  - **String Search**: Finds suspicious words or patterns.
  - **Metadata Review**: Examines file details for clues.
- **Pros:** Fast, safe, and efficient for initial malware screening.

### **Dynamic Analysis**

- Runs the malware in a safe, isolated setup to watch its actions.
- **Key Observations**:
  - **Network Activity**: Monitors connections and data flow.
  - **System Calls**: Tracks requests made by the malware to the OS.
  - **File Modifications**: Watches for changes to files or directories.
- **Purpose**: Gives a detailed view of how the malware behaves in real time.
- **Risks**: Dangerous if not properly isolated (e.g., ransomware could encrypt files or spread on a network).

### **Code Analysis**

- Involves,
  - Reverse Engineering of malware
  - Disassembling malware
  - Decompiling malware
- **Key Focus Areas**
  - **Logic and Functions**: Examines how the malware operates.
  - **Algorithms and Techniques**: Identifies methods for encryption, evasion, and exploitation.
  - **Concealed Functions**: Uncovers hidden capabilities.
  - **Command-and-Control (C2) Details**: Analyzes connections with external control systems.
- **Outcome**: Helps find Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and deeper insights into malware behavior.
