The process of analyzing malware by running it in a controlled environment like a sandbox.

## Environment Setup

For Dynamic analysis, we will be using the `Windows Powershell` file, which is from the Huntress CTF 2024 - `Russian Roulette` challenge. Here are the file details:

| Key                | Value                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| ZIP filename       | `russian_roulette.zip`   |
| Password           | `russian_roulette`       |
| Extracted filename | `Windows Powershell.lnk` |
| File Type          | `Windows Shortcut`       |
