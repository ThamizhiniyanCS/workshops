# Writing Yara and Sigma Rules

## Yara

### What is Yara?

[Yara](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers to identify and classify malware samples.

- Yara files are stored with `.yar` extension
- Yara files follow YAML syntax

[Getting started with Yara](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted.html)

### Example Yara rule

```yaml
/* Comment: yara_file.yar */
rule suspicious_strings
{
strings:
	$a = "Synflooding"
	$b = "Portscanner"
	$c = "Keylogger"

condition:
	($a or $b or $c)
}
```

### Components of Yara Rule

- **Meta**
  - Optional Section
  - Information that we define like author name, references, etc.,
  - Doesnâ€™t affect the YARA rules
- **Rule Identifiers**
  - Required Section
  - Name that describes the rule
  - Case Sensitive, Max 128 characters
  - `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]{1,127}$` -> Regex Pattern to match Rule Identifiers
  - Example: `rule Rule_Identifier_123`
- **String Definition**
  - Optional Section
  - strings that are part of the rule
    - text, hexadecimal, regular expression
  - This section can be omitted if the rule does not rely on any strings.
  - `^$[A-Za-z0-9_]*` -> Regex Pattern to match Strings Identifiers
  - These variables are used in the condition section
  - Example: `$String_1`
- **Condition Section**
  - Required Section
  - Logic of the rule
  - Contains Boolean Expressions based on which the rules matches or not

### Manually Writing a Yara Rule

We will be writing a Yara rule manually for the `Windows Powershell.lnk` malware.

For writing a Yara rule, first we should identify unique and suspicious strings from a malware. In the **Indicators of Compromise** section, for the `windows_powershell.lnk` file, we have identified unique base64 encoded string. We can use that here. Here is the simple yara rule with that base64 encoded string:

```yaml
/* Comment: yara_windows_powershell.yar */
rule windows_powershell_lnk
{
strings:
	$base64_encoded_string = "aQB3AHIAIABpAHMALgBnAGQALwBqAHcAcgA3AEoARAAgAC0AbwAgACQAZQBuAHYAOgBUAE0AUAAvAC4AYwBtAGQAOwAmACAAJABlAG4AdgA6AFQATQBQAC8ALgBjAG0AZAA="

condition:
	$base64_encoded_string
}
```

### Generating Yara Rule using yarGen

Now let's generate Yara rule for the same `windows_powershell.lnk` file using [yarGen](https://github.com/Neo23x0/yarGen). You can find the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/Neo23x0/yarGen?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

## Sigma

### What is Sigma?

[Sigma](https://sigmahq.io/) rules are a generic, open-source, and structured detection format used in cybersecurity to detect relevant log events in a simple and shareable way. They are designed to be platform-agnostic, allowing security teams to write a detection once and use it across various Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.

### Example Sigma rule

Here's a simple example of a **Sigma rule** that detects suspicious PowerShell execution in a Windows environment.

```yaml
title: Suspicious PowerShell Command
id: a6b56c9f-e007-4c54-b7e5-8f4adf7ccf12
status: experimental
description: Detects execution of suspicious PowerShell commands, such as those used for downloading files from the internet.
author: Your Name
date: 2025-01-03
logsource:
  category: process_creation
  product: windows
detection:
  selection:
    Image|endswith: '\powershell.exe'
    CommandLine|contains:
      - "Invoke-WebRequest"
      - "DownloadString"
  condition: selection
fields:
  - Image
  - CommandLine
level: high
tags:
  - attack.execution
  - attack.t1059.001
```
1. **Logsource**: Specifies the type of logs to analyze, e.g., process creation on Windows.
2. **Detection**: Looks for processes where:
   - The executed process is `powershell.exe`.
   - The command line includes keywords like `Invoke-WebRequest` or `DownloadString`.
3. **Fields**: Defines the fields to be returned (e.g., `Image` and `CommandLine`).
4. **Level**: Indicates the severity of the detection (`high`).
