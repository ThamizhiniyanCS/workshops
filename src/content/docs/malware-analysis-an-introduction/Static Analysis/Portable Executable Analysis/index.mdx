Examining the PE structure of Windows executables (e.g., headers, sections, imports) provides insight into its functionality and dependencies. This can be done using a lot of tools. We will be focusing on two tools mainly, [pestudio](https://www.winitor.com/) and [PE-Bear](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-bear). We will be using the [pefile](https://github.com/erocarrera/pefile) library for PE analysis with python.

You can find some common DLLs that you might encounter during analysis [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_library_files).
